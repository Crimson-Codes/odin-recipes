                <h2>Description</h2>

                    <p>I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best crispy fried<br>
                    chicken. This is it! It's bits and pieces of hints I have heard over the years. It's<br>
                    more a matter of preparation and cooking method!</p>

                    <p>This is the only crispy friend chicken recipe you'll ever need. Why? It combines all<br>
                    the tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juiciest, most flavorful, crispiest chicken<br>
                    every time.</p>

                    <p>There are a few reasons this crispy fried chicken works so well:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Allowing the buttermilk-flour mixture to come to a paste-like consistency is key<br>
                            to a crispiness on the outside and juiciness on the inside.</li>
                            <li>Most friend chicken is cooked at a high temperature throughout the frying<br>process.
                            This one, however, only starts at a very high heat - after browning, the<br>
                            heat is reduced for about 30 minutes. You'll turn up the temperature again at the<br>
                            end, locking in that crispy texture.</li>
                            <li>Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a slow smoke point, which helps with<br>
                            browning the chicken.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                    <p>Here's what you need to make the best, crispiest fried chicken of your life:</p>

                    <p><strong>Chicken</strong><br>
                    Cut a four-pound whole chicken into pieces or purchase four pounds of breasts,<br>
                    drumsticks, wings, legs, and/or thighs at the grocery store.</p>

                    <p><strong>Buttermilk</strong><br>
                    Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it too tough. Also, it<br>
                    helps the flour mixture stick to the chicken</p>

                    <p><strong>Flour</strong><br>
                    All-purpose flour gives the buttermilk and seasonings something to stick to,<br>
                    while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust.</p>

                    <p><strong>Seasonings</strong><br>
                    This crispy friend chicken recipe calls for paprika (which helps with browning),<br>
                    salt, and pepper. You can addmore spices and seasonings to taste.</p>

                    <p><strong>Oil</strong><br>
                    Vegetable oil is perfect for frying chicken because it has a high smoke point.</p>

                    <p><strong>Recipe specific ingredients breakdown:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>1(4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
                        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
                        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
                    </ul>

                <h2>Steps</h2>

                    <p>You'll find the step-by-step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you<br>
                    can expect when you make this crispy fried chicken:</p>

                    <h3>Make the Breading</h3>
                    <p>Combine the flour, paprika, salt, and pepper ina zip-top bag. Seal the bag and<br>
                    shake until well-combined.</p>

                    <h3>Dredge the Chicken</h3>
                    <p>Pour the buttermilk into a shallow bowl, then dip the chicken (on both sides) until<br>
                    it's completely soaked in buttermilk. Place the soaked chicken in the bag with<br>
                    flour mixture, seal, and shake well to coat. Transfer the coated chicken to a<br>
                    baking sheet, and cover. Allow the flour coating to become a past-like<br>
                    consistency.</p>

                    <h3>Fry the Chicken</h3>
                    <p>Pour the oil in a skillet and bring it to high heat. Brown the chicken on both<br>
                    sides, then reduce the heat, cover the skillet, and ccook for about 30 minutes.<br>
                    Remove the cover, return the heat to high, and fry until extra crispy. Drain the<br>
                    chicken on paper towels.</p>
