Hi fellow Odinites! this is my project entry for the first HTML project of the HTML foundations course. In this
project I have applied the basic html skills; many of such are headings, paragraphs, hyperlinks, images, etc.

For a first project, I would say that I feel quite accomplished with my work and I look forward to learning new concepts and skills even further with the next section. Keep it strong!
